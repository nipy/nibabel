* 1.0.0 (Thursday, 13, Oct 2010)

  * This is the first public release of the NiBabel package.
  * NiBabel is a complete rewrite of the PyNifti package in pure python.  It was
    designed to make the code simpler and easier to work with. Like PyNifti,
    NiBabel has fairly comprehensive NIfTI read and write support.
  * Extended support for SPM Analyze images, including orientation affines from
    matlab ``.mat`` files.

    have MINC files that we don't support well.
  * Support for reading and writing PAR/REC images (MH)
  * ``parrec2nii`` script to convert PAR/REC images to NIfTI format (MH)
  * Very preliminary, limited and highly experimental DICOM reading support (MB,
    Ian Nimmo Smith).
  * Some functions (`nibabel.funcs`) for basic image shape changes, including
    the ability to transform to the image with data closest to the cononical
    image orientation (first axis left-to-right, second back-to-front, third
    down-to-up) (MB, Jonathan Taylor)
  * Gifti format read and write support (preliminary) (Stephen Gerhard) 
  * Added utilities to use nipy-style data packages, by rip then edit of nipy
    data package code (MB)
  * Some improvements to release support (Jarrod Millman, MB, Fernando Perez)
  * Huge downward step in the quality and coverage by the docs, caused by MB,
    mostly fixed by a lot of good work by MH.
  * NiBabel will not work with Python < 2.5, and we haven't even tested it with
    Python 3.  We will get to it soon...

Modifications are done by Michael Hanke, if not indicated otherwise. 'Closes'
statement IDs refer to the Debian bug tracking system and can be queried by
visiting the URL::

  http://bugs.debian.org/<bug id>

* 0.20100706.1 (Tue, 6 Jul 2010)

  * Bugfix: NiftiFormat.vx2s() used the qform not the sform. Thanks to Tom
    Holroyd for reporting.

* 0.20100412.1 (Mon, 12 Apr 2010)

  * Bugfix: Unfortunate interaction between Python garbage collection and C
    library caused memory problems. Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko for the
    diagnose and fix.

* 0.20090303.1 (Tue, 3 Mar 2009)

  * Bugfix: Updating the NIfTI header from a dictionary was broken.
  * Bugfix: Removed left-over print statement in extension code.
  * Bugfix: Prevent saving of bogus 'None.nii' images when the filename
    was previously assign, before calling NiftiImage.save() (Closes: #517920).
  * Bugfix: Extension length was to short for all `edata` whos length matches
    n*16-8, for all integer n.

* 0.20090205.1 (Thu, 5 Feb 2009)

  * This release is the first in a series that aims stabilize the API and
    finally result in PyNIfTI 1.0 with full support of the NIfTI1 standard.
  * The whole package was restructured. The included renaming
    `nifti.nifti(image,format,clibs)` to `nifti.(image,format,clibs)`. Redirect
    modules make sure that existing user code will not break, but they will
    issue a DeprecationWarning and will be removed with the release of PyNIfTI
    1.0.
  * Added a special extension that can embed any serializable Python object
    into the NIfTI file header. The contents of this extension is
    automatically expanded upon request into the `.meta` attribute of each
    NiftiImage. When saving files to disk the content of the dictionary is also
    automatically dumped into this extension.
    Embedded meta data is not loaded automatically, since this has security
    implications, because code from the file header is actually executed.
    The documentation explicitely mentions this risk.
  * Added :class:`~nifti.extensions.NiftiExtensions`. This is a container-like
    handler to access and manipulate NIfTI1 header extensions.
  * Exposed :class:`~nifti.image.MemMappedNiftiImage` in the root module.
  * Moved :func:`~nifti.utils.cropImage` into the :mod:`~nifti.utils` module.
  * From now on Sphinx is used to generate the documentation. This includes a
    module reference that replaces that old API reference.
  * Added methods :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.vx2q` and
    :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.vx2s` to convert voxel indices into
    coordinates defined by qform or sform respectively.
  * Updating the `cal_min` and `cal_max` values in the NIfTI header when
    saving a file is now conditional, but remains enabled by default.
  * Full set of methods to query and modify axis units. This includes
    expanding the previous `xyzt_units` field in the header dictionary into
    editable `xyz_unit` and `time_unit` fields. The former `xyzt_units` field
    is no longer available. See:
    :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.getXYZUnit`,
    :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.setXYZUnit`,
    :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.getTimeUnit`,
    :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.setTimeUnit`,
    :attr:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.xyz_unit`,
    :attr:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.time_unit`
  * Full set of methods to query and manuipulate qform and sform codes. See:
    :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.getQFormCode`,
    :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.setQFormCode`,
    :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.getSFormCode`,
    :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.setSFormCode`,
    :attr:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.qform_code`,
    :attr:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.sform_code`
  * Each image instance is now able to generate a human-readable dump of its
    most important header information via `__str__()`.
  * :class:`~nifti.image.NiftiImage` objects can now be pickled.
  * Switched to NumPy's distutils for building the package. Cleaned and
    simplified the build procedure. Added optimization flags to SWIG call.
  * :attr:`nifti.image.NiftiImage.filename` can now also be used to assign a
    filename.
  * Introduced :data:`nifti.__version__` as canonical version string.
  * Removed `updateQFormFromQuarternion()` from the list of public methods of
    :class:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat`. This is an internal method that
    should not be used in user code. However, a redirect to the new method
    will remain in-place until PyNIfTI 1.0.
  * Bugfix: :meth:`~nifti.image.NiftiImage.getScaledData` returns a
    unmodified data array if `slope` is set to zero (as required by the NIfTI
    standard). Thanks to Thomas Ross for reporting.
  * Bugfix: Unicode filenames are now handled properly, as long as they do not
    contain pure-unicode characters (since the NIfTI library does not support
    them). Thanks to Gaël Varoquaux for reporting this issue.

* 0.20081017.1 (Fri, 17 Oct 2008)

  * Updated included minimal copy of the nifticlibs to version 1.1.0.
  * Few changes to the Makefiles to enhance Posix compatibility. Thanks to
    Chris Burns.
  * When building on non-Debian systems, only add include and library paths
    pointing to the local nifticlibs copy, when it is actually built.
    On Debian system the local copy is still not used at all, as a proper
    nifticlibs package is guaranteed to be available.
  * Added minimal setup_egg.py for setuptools users. Thanks to Gaël Varoquaux.
  * PyNIfTI now does a proper wrapping of the image data with NumPy arrays,
    which no longer leads to accidental memory leaks, when accessing array
    data that has not been copied before (e.g. via the *data* property of
    NiftiImage). Thanks to Gaël Varoquaux for mentioning this possibility.

* 0.20080710.1 (Thu, 7 Jul 2008)

  * Bugfix: Pointer bug introduced by switch to new NumPy API in 0.20080624
    Thanks to Christopher Burns for fixing it.
  * Bugfix: Honored DeprecationWarning: sync() -> flush() for memory mapped
    arrays. Again thanks to Christopher Burns.
  * More unit tests and other improvements (e.g. fixed circular imports) done
    by Christopher Burns.

* 0.20080630.1 (Tue, 30 Jun 2008)

  * Bugfix: NiftiImage caused a memory leak by not calling the NiftiFormat
    destructor.
  * Bugfix: Merged bashism-removal patch from Debian packaging.


* 0.20080624.1 (Tue, 24 Jun 2008)

  * Converted all documentation (including docstrings) into the restructured
    text format.
  * Improved Makefile.
  * Included configuration and Makefile support for profiling, API doc
    generation (via epydoc) and code quality checks (with PyLint).
  * Consistently import NumPy as N.
  * Bugfix: Proper handling of [qs]form codes, which previously have not been
    handled at all. Thanks to Christopher Burns for pointing it out.
  * Bugfix: Make NiftiFormat work without setFilename(). Thanks to Benjamin
    Thyreau for reporting.
  * Bugfix: setPixDims() stored meaningless values.
  * Use new NumPy API and replace deprecated function calls
    (`PyArray_FromDimsAndData`).
  * Initial support for memory mapped access to uncompressed NIfTI files
    (`MemMappedNiftiImage`).
  * Add a proper Makefile and setup.cfg for compiling PyNIfTI under Windows
    with MinGW.
  * Include a minimal copy of the most recent nifticlibs (just libniftiio and
    znzlib; version 1.0), to lower the threshold to build PyNIfTI on systems
    that do not provide a developer package for those libraries.


* 0.20070930.1 (Sun, 30 Sep 2007)

  * Relicense under the MIT license, to be compatible with SciPy license.
    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
  * Updated documentation.


* 0.20070917.1 (Mon, 17 Sep 2007)

  * Bugfix: Can now update NIfTI header data when no filename is set
    (Closes: #442175).
  * Unloading of image data without a filename set is no checked and prevented
    as it would damage data integrity and the image data could not be
    recovered.
  * Added 'pixdim' property (Yaroslav Halchenko).


* 0.20070905.1  (Wed, 5 Sep 2007)

  * Fixed a bug in the qform/quaternion handling that caused changes to the
    qform to vanish when saving to file (Yaroslav Halchenko).
  * Added more unit tests.
  * 'dim' vector in the NIfTI header is now guaranteed to only contain
    non-zero elements. This caused problems with some applications.


* 0.20070803.1 (Fri, 3 Aug 2007)

  * Does not depend on SciPy anymore.
  * Initial steps towards a unittest suite.
  * pynifti_pst can now print the peristimulus signal matrix for a single
    voxel (onsets x time) for easier processing of this information in
    external applications.
  * utils.getPeristimulusTimeseries() can now be used to compute mean and
    variance of the signal (among others).
  * pynifti_pst is able to compute more than just the mean peristimulus
    timeseries (e.g. variance and standard deviation).
  * Set default image description when saving a file if none is present.
  * Improved documentation.


* 0.20070425.1 (Wed, 25 Apr 2007)

  * Improved documentation. Added note about the special usage of the header
    property. Also added notes about the relevant properties in the docstring
    of the corresponding accessor methods.
  * Added property and accessor methods to access/modify the repetition time
    of timeseries (dt).
  * Added functions to manipulate the pixdim values.
  * Added utils.py with some utility functions.
  * Added functions/property to determine the bounding box of an image.
  * Fixed a bug that caused a corrupted sform matrix when converting a NumPy
    array and a header dictionary into a NIfTI image.
  * Added script to compute peristimulus timeseries (pynifti_pst).
  * Package now depends on python-scipy.


* 0.20070315.1 (Thu, 15 Mar 2007)

  * Removed functionality for "NiftiImage.save() raises an IOError
    exception when writing the image file fails." (Yaroslav Halchenko)
  * Added ability to force a filetype when setting the filename or saving 
    a file.
  * Reverse the order of the 'header' and 'load' argument in the NiftiImage
    constructor. 'header' is now first as it seems to be used more often.
  * Improved the source code documentation.
  * Added getScaledData() method to NiftiImage that returns a copy of the data
    array that is scaled with the slope and intercept stored in the NIfTI
    header.


* 0.20070301.2 (Thu, 1 Mar 2007)

  * Fixed wrong link to the source tarball in README.html. 


* 0.20070301.1 (Thu, 1 Mar 2007)

  * Initial upload to the Debian archive. (Closes: #413049)
  * NiftiImage.save() raises an IOError exception when writing the image file
    fails.

    class (Yaroslav Halchenko).


* 0.20070220.1 (Tue, 20 Feb 2007)

  * NiftiFile class is renamed to NiftiImage.
  * SWIG-wrapped libniftiio functions are no available in the nifticlib
    module.
  * Fixed broken NiftiImage from Numpy array constructor.
  * Added initial documentation in README.html.
  * Fulfilled a number of Yarik's wishes ;)


* 0.20070214.1 (Wed, 14 Feb 2007)

  * Does not depend on libfslio anymore.
  * Up to seven-dimensional dataset are supported (as much as NIfTI can do).
  * The complete NIfTI header dataset is modifiable.
  * Most image properties are accessable via class attributes and accessor
    methods.
  * Improved documentation (but still a long way to go).


* 0.20061114 (Tue, 14 Nov 2006)

  * Initial release.
