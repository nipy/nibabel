NiBabel
=======

This package provides read and write access to some common medical and
neuroimaging file formats, including: ANALYZE_ (plain, SPM99, SPM2),
GIFTI_, NIfTI1_, MINC_, MGH_ and ECAT_ as well as PAR/REC.  We can read and
write Freesurfer_ geometry, and read Freesurfer morphometry and annotation
files.  There is some very limited support for DICOM_.  NiBabel is the successor
of PyNIfTI_.

.. _ANALYZE: http://www.grahamwideman.com/gw/brain/analyze/formatdoc.htm
.. _NIfTI1: http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/
.. _MINC: http://wiki.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/index.php/MINC
.. _PyNIfTI: http://niftilib.sourceforge.net/pynifti/
.. _GIFTI: http://www.nitrc.org/projects/gifti

.. _ECAT: http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net/Docs/Ecat
.. _Freesurfer: http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu
.. _DICOM: http://medical.nema.org/

The various image format classes give full or selective access to header (meta)
information and access to the image data is made available via NumPy arrays.
