"""Define static nibabel metadata for nibabel

The long description parameter is used in the nibabel top-level docstring,
and in building the docs.
We exec this file in several places, so it cannot import nibabel or use
relative imports.
"""

# Note: this long_description is the canonical place to edit this text.
# It also appears in README.rst, but it should get there by running
# ``tools/refresh_readme.py`` which pulls in this version.
# We also include this text in the docs by ``..include::`` in
# ``docs/source/index.rst``.
long_description = """
Read and write access to common neuroimaging file formats, including:
ANALYZE_ (plain, SPM99, SPM2 and later), GIFTI_, NIfTI1_, NIfTI2_, `CIFTI-2`_,
MINC1_, MINC2_, `AFNI BRIK/HEAD`_, ECAT_ and Philips PAR/REC.
In addition, NiBabel also supports FreeSurfer_'s MGH_, geometry, annotation and
morphometry files, and provides some limited support for DICOM_.

NiBabel's API gives full or selective access to header information (metadata),
and image data is made available via NumPy arrays. For more information, see
NiBabel's `documentation site`_ and `API reference`_.
