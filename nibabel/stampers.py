""" State stamps

A state stamp is something that defines the state of an object. Let's say we have
an object ``X`` is in a state $S$.

Let's call the state stamp finder ``get_state_stamp``.  This could be the result
of ``get_state_stamp = Stamper()`` below, for example.

The *state stamp* of ``X`` is some value ``g`` such that ``get_state_stamp(X) ==
g`` if and only if ``X`` is in state $S$ - however defined.

``get_state_stamp(Y) == g`` should in general not be true if ``Y`` is a
different class for ``X``.

Thus the state stamp guarantees a particular state of ``X`` - as defined by you,
dear programmer. Conversely, if ``get_state_stamp(X) != g`` this does not
guarantee they are different.  It may be that you (dear programmer) don't know
if they are different, and do not want to spend resources on working it out.
For example, if ``X`` is a huge array, you might want to return the
``Unknown()`` state stamp.

The state stamp ``Unknown()`` is the state stamp such that ``get_state_stamp(X) ==
Unknown()`` is always False.

If you have objects you want compared, you can do one of:

* define a ``state_stamp`` method, taking a single argument ``caller`` which is
  the callable from which the method has been called. You can then return
  something which is unique for the states you want to be able to distinguish.
  Don't forget that (usually) stamps from objects of different types should
  compare unequal.
* subclass the ``Stamper`` class, and extend the ``__call__`` method to
  handle a new object type.  The ``NdaStamper`` class below is an example.

It's up to the object how to do the stamping.  In general, don't test what the
stamp is, test whether it compares equal in the situations you are expecting, so
that the object can change it's mind about how it will do the stamping without
you having to rewrite the tests.

    Notes
    -----
    You would think this could be a singleton, but not so, because:

    >>> u = Unknown()
    >>> (1, u) == (1, u)
    True

    Why?  Because comparisons within sequences in CPython, use
    ``PyObject_RichCompareBool`` for the elements. See around line 572 in
    ``objects/tupleobject.c`` and around line 607 in ``objects/object.c`` in
    cpython 69528:fecf9e6d7630.  This does an identity check equivalent to ``u
    is u``; if this passes it does not do a further equality check (``u == u``).
    For that reason, if you want to make sure nothing matches ``Unknown()``
    within sequences, you need a fresh instances.
