        .. WARNING::

            We recommend you use the ``get_fdata`` method instead of the
            ``get_data`` method, because it is easier to predict the return
            data type.  ``get_data`` will be deprecated around November 2019
            and removed around November 2021.

            If you don't care about the predictability of the return data type,
            and you want the minimum possible data size in memory, you can
            replicate the array that would be returned by ``img.get_data()`` by
            using ``np.asanyarray(img.dataobj)``.

        The image ``dataobj`` property can be an array proxy or an array.  An
        array proxy is an object that knows how to load the image data from
        disk.  An image with an array proxy ``dataobj`` is a *proxy image*; an
        image with an array in ``dataobj`` is an *array image*.

        The default behavior for ``get_data()`` on a proxy image is to read the
        data from the proxy, and store in an internal cache.  Future calls to
        ``get_data`` will return the cached array.  This is the behavior
        selected with `caching` == "fill".

        Once the data has been cached and returned from an array proxy, if you
        modify the returned array, you will also modify the cached array
        (because they are the same array).  Regardless of the `caching` flag,
        this is always true of an array image.

        Parameters
        ----------
        caching : {'fill', 'unchanged'}, optional
            See the Notes section for a detailed explanation.  This argument
            specifies whether the image object should fill in an internal
            cached reference to the returned image data array. "fill" specifies
            that the image should fill an internal cached reference if
            currently empty.  Future calls to ``get_data`` will return this
            cached reference.  You might prefer "fill" to save the image object
            from having to reload the array data from disk on each call to
            ``get_data``.  "unchanged" means that the image should not fill in
            the internal cached reference if the cache is currently empty.  You
            might prefer "unchanged" to "fill" if you want to make sure that
            the call to ``get_data`` does not create an extra (cached)
            reference to the returned array.  In this case it is easier for
            Python to free the memory from the returned array.

        Returns
        -------
        data : array
            array of image data

        See also
        --------
        uncache: empty the array data cache

        Notes
        -----
        All images have a property ``dataobj`` that represents the image array
        data.  Images that have been loaded from files usually do not load the
        array data from file immediately, in order to reduce image load time
        and memory use.  For these images, ``dataobj`` is an *array proxy*; an
        object that knows how to load the image array data from file.

        By default (`caching` == "fill"), when you call ``get_data`` on a
        proxy image, we load the array data from disk, store (cache) an
        internal reference to this array data, and return the array.  The next
        time you call ``get_data``, you will get the cached reference to the
        array, so we don't have to load the array data from disk again.

        Array images have a ``dataobj`` property that already refers to an
        array in memory, so there is no benefit to caching, and the `caching`
        keywords have no effect.

        For proxy images, you may not want to fill the cache after reading the
        data from disk because the cache will hold onto the array memory until
        the image object is deleted, or you use the image ``uncache`` method.
        If you don't want to fill the cache, then always use
        ``get_data(caching='unchanged')``; in this case ``get_data`` will not
        fill the cache (store the reference to the array) if the cache is empty
        (no reference to the array).  If the cache is full, "unchanged" leaves
        the cache full and returns the cached array reference.

        The cache can affect the behavior of the image, because if the cache is
        full, or you have an array image, then modifying the returned array
        will modify the result of future calls to ``get_data()``.  For example
        you might do this:

        >>> import os
        >>> import nibabel as nib
        >>> from nibabel.testing import data_path
        >>> img_fname = os.path.join(data_path, 'example4d.nii.gz')

        >>> img = nib.load(img_fname) # This is a proxy image
        >>> nib.is_proxy(img.dataobj)
        True

        The array is not yet cached by a call to "get_data", so:

        >>> img.in_memory
        False

        After we call ``get_data`` using the default `caching` == 'fill', the
        cache contains a reference to the returned array ``data``:

        >>> data = img.get_data()
        >>> img.in_memory
        True

        We modify an element in the returned data array:

        >>> data[0, 0, 0, 0]
        0
        >>> data[0, 0, 0, 0] = 99
        >>> data[0, 0, 0, 0]
        99

        The next time we call 'get_data', the method returns the cached
        reference to the (modified) array:

        >>> data_again = img.get_data()
        >>> data_again is data
        True
        >>> data_again[0, 0, 0, 0]
        99

        If you had *initially* used `caching` == 'unchanged' then the returned
        ``data`` array would have been loaded from file, but not cached, and:

        >>> img = nib.load(img_fname)  # a proxy image again
        >>> data = img.get_data(caching='unchanged')
        >>> img.in_memory
        False
        >>> data[0, 0, 0] = 99
        >>> data_again = img.get_data(caching='unchanged')
        >>> data_again is data
        False
        >>> data_again[0, 0, 0, 0]
        0
